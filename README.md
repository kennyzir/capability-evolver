## Real-World Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Production Incident Response
**Problem**: Your agent crashed in production and you need to understand why

**Solution**:
1. Export last 1000 log entries
2. Run analyze action
3. Get error patterns and cascades
4. Identify root cause in minutes

**Example**:
```typescript
const logs = await db.logs.findMany({ 
  where: { timestamp: { gte: incidentStart } },
  orderBy: { timestamp: 'asc' }
});

const analysis = await claw0x.call('capability-evolver', {
  action: 'analyze',
  logs: logs.map(l => ({
    timestamp: l.timestamp,
    level: l.level,
    message: l.message,
    context: l.context
  }))
});

// analysis.patterns shows: "auth-service.ts failed, then payment-api.ts failed"
// Root cause: auth service timeout cascaded to payment failures
```

### Scenario 2: Continuous Improvement Pipeline
**Problem**: You want your agent to automatically improve based on production data

**Solution**:
1. Schedule daily log analysis
2. Generate evolution proposals
3. Auto-create GitHub issues for high-priority items
4. Track improvement over time

**Example**:
```javascript
// Cron job: every day at 2am
async function dailyEvolution() {
  const logs = await getLast24HoursLogs();
  
  const evolution = await claw0x.call('capability-evolver', {
    action: 'evolve',
    logs,
    strategy: 'balanced'
  });
  
  // Create issues for critical recommendations
  for (const rec of evolution.recommendations.filter(r => r.priority === 'critical')) {
    await github.issues.create({
      title: `[Auto] ${rec.category}: ${rec.description}`,
      body: `Risk: ${rec.risk}\nApproach: ${rec.approach}`,
      labels: ['auto-generated', 'reliability']
    });
  }
  
  // Track health score trend
  await metrics.record('agent_health_score', evolution.estimated_improvement);
}
// Result: Health score improved from 45 to 85 over 3 months
```

### Scenario 3: Multi-Agent Fleet Management
**Problem**: Managing 50+ agent instances, need to identify systemic issues

**Solution**:
1. Aggregate logs from all agents
2. Batch analyze to find common patterns
3. Fix once, deploy to all agents
4. Reduce fleet-wide error rate

**Example**:
```python
# Collect logs from all agents
all_logs = []
for agent_id in agent_fleet:
    logs = fetch_agent_logs(agent_id, last_24h)
    all_logs.extend(logs)

# Analyze fleet-wide
result = client.call("capability-evolver", {
    "action": "analyze",
    "logs": all_logs
})

# result.patterns shows: "40 of 50 agents failing on auth-service.ts"
# Fix auth-service.ts once, deploy to all agents
# Result: 80% reduction in fleet-wide errors
```

### Scenario 4: Pre-Deployment Health Check
**Problem**: Want to ensure new deployment doesn't introduce regressions

**Solution**:
1. Analyze logs from staging environment
2. Compare health score to production baseline
3. Block deployment if health score drops
4. Catch regressions before production

**Example**:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- name: Health Check
  run: |
    STAGING_LOGS=$(fetch-logs staging)
    
    RESULT=$(curl -X POST https://api.claw0x.com/v1/call \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAW0X_API_KEY" \
      -d "{\"skill\":\"capability-evolver\",\"input\":{\"action\":\"analyze\",\"logs\":$STAGING_LOGS}}")
    
    HEALTH_SCORE=$(echo $RESULT | jq -r '.health_score')
    BASELINE=75
    
    if [ $HEALTH_SCORE -lt $BASELINE ]; then
      echo "Health score $HEALTH_SCORE below baseline $BASELINE"
      exit 1
    fi
# Result: Zero regression-related incidents in 6 months
```

## Integration Recipes

### OpenClaw Agent
```typescript
import { Claw0xClient } from '@claw0x/sdk';

const claw0x = new Claw0xClient(process.env.CLAW0X_API_KEY);

// Analyze logs after each run
agent.onComplete(async () => {
  const logs = agent.getRecentLogs();
  
  const analysis = await claw0x.call('capability-evolver', {
    action: 'analyze',
    logs
  });
  
  if (analysis.health_score < 70) {
    console.warn('⚠️ Health score low:', analysis.health_score);
    console.log('Recommendations:', analysis.recommendations);
  }
});
```

### LangChain Agent
```python
from claw0x import Claw0xClient
import os

client = Claw0xClient(api_key=os.getenv("CLAW0X_API_KEY"))

def analyze_agent_health(logs):
    result = client.call("capability-evolver", {
        "action": "analyze",
        "logs": logs
    })
    
    return {
        "health_score": result["health_score"],
        "patterns": result["patterns"],
        "recommendations": result["recommendations"]
    }

# Use in monitoring
health = analyze_agent_health(agent.logs)
if health["health_score"] < 70:
    alert_team(health)
```

### Custom Monitoring Dashboard
```javascript
// Real-time health monitoring
async function updateHealthDashboard() {
  const logs = await db.logs.findMany({
    where: { timestamp: { gte: Date.now() - 3600000 } } // last hour
  });
  
  const analysis = await fetch('https://api.claw0x.com/v1/call', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.CLAW0X_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      skill: 'capability-evolver',
      input: { action: 'analyze', logs }
    })
  });
  
  const result = await analysis.json();
  
  // Update dashboard
  dashboard.update({
    healthScore: result.health_score,
    errorRate: result.summary.error_count / result.summary.total_logs,
    topPatterns: result.patterns.slice(0, 5)
  });
}

setInterval(updateHealthDashboard, 60000); // every minute
```

### Evolution Strategy Comparison
```typescript
// Compare different evolution strategies
const logs = await getProductionLogs();

const strategies = ['balanced', 'innovate', 'harden', 'repair-only'];

const results = await Promise.all(
  strategies.map(strategy =>
    claw0x.call('capability-evolver', {
      action: 'evolve',
      logs,
      strategy
    })
  )
);

// Compare estimated improvements
for (let i = 0; i < strategies.length; i++) {
  console.log(`${strategies[i]}: ${results[i].estimated_improvement}`);
}

// Choose best strategy for current situation
const best = results.reduce((a, b) => 
  parseFloat(a.estimated_improvement) > parseFloat(b.estimated_improvement) ? a : b
);
```

## How It Works — Under the Hood

Capability Evolver is a deterministic analysis engine that processes structured log data and produces actionable diagnostics. No LLM is involved �?the analysis is rule-based, which means results are reproducible and fast.

### Analysis Engine

The core engine processes log entries through several analysis passes:

1. **Pattern detection** �?logs are grouped by `context` (file/module) and `level` (error/warn/info/debug). The engine looks for:
   - **Repeated errors** �?the same error message appearing multiple times indicates a systemic issue, not a transient failure
   - **Error cascades** �?errors in module A followed by errors in module B within a short time window suggest a dependency chain failure
   - **Regression signals** �?errors that appear after a period of clean logs suggest a recent change broke something
   - **Inefficiency patterns** �?excessive warn-level logs or repeated retries indicate performance issues

2. **Health scoring** �?a system health score (0�?00) is computed based on:
   - Error rate (errors / total logs)
   - Error diversity (unique error messages / total errors)
   - Warn-to-error ratio
   - Time distribution (clustered errors score worse than spread-out errors)

3. **Recommendation generation** �?based on detected patterns, the engine generates specific, actionable recommendations. These aren't generic advice �?they reference the actual files, error messages, and patterns found in your logs.

### Evolution Strategies

When using the `evolve` action, you can choose a strategy that shapes the recommendations:

| Strategy | Focus | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `auto` | Balanced based on health score | Default �?let the engine decide |
| `balanced` | Equal weight to reliability and features | Stable systems with moderate issues |
| `innovate` | Prioritize new capabilities | Healthy systems ready to grow |
| `harden` | Prioritize reliability and error reduction | Systems with frequent failures |
| `repair-only` | Fix critical issues only | Systems in crisis |

### Evolution Proposals

The `evolve` action produces structured improvement proposals with:
- A unique `evolution_id` for tracking
- Prioritized recommendations with category labels (reliability, performance, architecture)
- Risk assessment (how risky is each proposed change)
- Estimated improvement (projected health score after implementing recommendations)

### Why Deterministic (Not LLM)?

- **Reproducible** �?same logs always produce the same analysis. Critical for debugging and auditing.
- **Fast** �?sub-100ms processing. No API call to an AI provider.
- **No hallucination risk** �?the engine only reports patterns it actually found in the data.
- **Cost-effective** �?pure computation, no token costs.

The tradeoff: the engine can't understand semantic meaning in log messages the way an LLM could. It relies on structural patterns (frequency, timing, severity) rather than understanding what the error message means in context.

## Prerequisites
